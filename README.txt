BubbleLoad
version 1.00 by Lachlan (http://steamcommunity.com/id/UnresolvedVice)

Thanks for purchasing BubbleLoad, you're awesome!

** INSTALLATION **
1) You'll need a webserver for this. Any webhost that has
the most recent version PHP will do just fine.
2) Extract the "BubbleLoad" folder onto your web server.
3) Set your configurations in js/config.js.
4) Add sv_loading url "http://yourwebsite.com/BubbleLoad/?steamid=%s"
to your server.cfg.
5) Type exec server.cfg into your console or restart your server.
6) You're done!

** CONFIGURATION **
Please ONLY mess with the config.js you can find in js/config.js as things might
get really buggy if you edit anything elsewhere.

Thanks once again for purchasing BubbleLoad, and if you need any support,
you can either contact me on ScriptFodder, or add me on steam here:
